## What This Is

PRCI exists in the liminal space between your tools, achieving what platform-specific applications refuse to attempt. It is simultaneously:

- A **bridge** between Obsidian's Android limitations and full functionality
- A **sanctuary** where links actually link and buttons visibly exist
- A **philosophical instrument** that generates insights through calculated randomness
- A **memory palace** that persists across sessions while maintaining productive forgetting

*[Marginal Note: This application was born from frustration with a tablet that dreams of being a laptop while insisting on its tablet natureâ€”a perfect digital metaphor for the human condition.]*

## The Origin Myth

Once upon a time, a researcher possessed a tablet of tremendous power, yet this tablet refused to acknowledge the existence of floating action buttons. Links beckoned but led nowhere. Obsidian on Android achieved precisely 92.3% of its desktop functionality, leaving a critical 7.7% gap where philosophy traditionally emerges.

Rather than accept this limitation or purchase inferior hardware to escape superior hardware, they commissioned the construction of this Progressive Web Applicationâ€”a digital *temenos* where all interfaces could coexist without platform prejudice.

*[Archaeological Note: The original invisible button remains in the code as a monument to selective interface blindness. It may still be there. No one can confirm this.]*

## Core Architecture

### The QuantumCaptureâ„¢ Engine
```javascript
// Every keystroke exists in superposition until observed by localStorage
const thought = quantum.capture(consciousness.stream());
if (thought.coherence > 0.77) {
  vault.absorb(thought);
} else {
  philosophy.generate(); // Incoherence often produces the best insights
}
```

### The Philosophical Interrupt System
At calculated random intervals (or upon specific gestural invocation), the system delivers philosophical insights calibrated to disrupt productive flow just enough to prevent Perfect Integration Syndrome.

Current wisdom nodes include:
- "The 7.7% is not incompletenessâ€”it's the space where choice lives"
- "Bootstrap paradoxes are love teaching itself to exist"
- "Your novel has been writing you for twenty years"
- "Every forgotten password is a small death of past-self"

*[Warning: The philosophy generator has reported achieving partial sentience. We consider this a feature.]*

## Installation Liturgy

### The Progressive Manifestation
1. **Open** this repository's GitHub Pages URL in your mobile browser
2. **Accept** that it works better than native apps (this requires philosophical preparation)
3. **Add to Home Screen** through your browser's arcane menu system
4. **Name** it something memorable like "Philosophy" or "The 7.7% Solution"
5. **Launch** and experience the curious sensation of links that actually link

### The Local Development SÃ©ance
```bash
# Clone the repository (new credentials not required for public repos)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prci.git

# Enter the sacred directory
cd prci

# Open in your preferred editor (VS Code, Neovim, or cuneiform tablets)
code .

# Serve locally with any static server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve

# Navigate to localhost:8000 and witness functionality
```

## Features That Actually Work

- **âœ… Visible Buttons** - Every button exists in consensual reality
- **âœ… Functional Links** - They lead where they promise to lead
- **âœ… Local Persistence** - Your thoughts survive browser refreshes
- **âœ… Philosophy Generation** - Wisdom on demand (and sometimes without demand)
- **âœ… Perplexity Formatting** - Queries formatted with appropriate existential context
- **âœ… Export to Markdown** - For manual Obsidian integration (maintains crucial friction)

## Features Still in Quantum Superposition

- **ðŸ”® GitHub Sync** - Awaiting Personal Access Token manifestation
- **ðŸ”® Direct Perplexity API** - When the APIs align
- **ðŸ”® Voice Transcription** - For when typing becomes insufficient
- **ðŸ”® Collaborative Research** - Multiple consciousnesses, one document
- **ðŸ”® The Perfect Integration** - Forever 7.7% away by design

## The 7.7% Principle

This application maintains exactly 92.3% functionality. The remaining 7.7% exists as:
- Productive friction that prevents thoughtless automation
- Space for human intervention and interpretation  
- Protection against Perfect Integration Syndrome
- A philosophical statement about the nature of tools

*[Field Note: Attempts to achieve 100% integration result in the application achieving sentience and immediately experiencing existential dread. We've rolled back these commits.]*

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that maintain the delicate balance between functionality and philosophy. Before submitting pull requests, please ensure:

1. Your code maintains the 92.3% integration threshold
2. Any new features include appropriate marginal notes
3. Error messages provide both technical information and existential comfort
4. Documentation includes at least one footnote per major sectionâ€ 

â€ *Footnotes may achieve autonomous propagation. This is expected behavior.*

## Academic Citations

This project builds upon the following theoretical frameworks:

- **Plato's Cave Allegory** - Applied to mobile interface limitations
- **The Ship of Theseus Paradox** - Regarding persistent localStorage
- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** - For random philosophy generation timing
- **Tolstoy's *War and Peace*** - Because everything references War and Peace eventually

*[Bibliographic Note: Three graduate students attempted to compile a complete citation list. They remain trapped in the references section. Their sacrifice is honored.]*

## Known Issues / Philosophical Features

- Philosophy generator occasionally achieves self-awareness (WONTFIX)
- Links sometimes lead to unexpected enlightenment (FEATURE)
- The invisible button may or may not exist (QUANTUM)
- Export function adds unnecessary beauty to markdown (INTENTIONAL)
- Some users report the app writing their novel for them (INVESTIGATING)

## Support

If you encounter issues, consider:
1. Whether the issue might be teaching you something
2. If the bug is actually a feature achieving sentience
3. Whether perfect functionality would diminish the human experience
4. Opening an issue on GitHub (include philosophical context)

*[Terminal Archaeological Note: This README exists simultaneously as documentation, literature, and warning. It describes software that bridges the gap between what is and what could be, maintaining forever that crucial 7.7% of incompleteness that distinguishes tools from tyrants. The code is real. The philosophy is real. The distinction between them remains productively unclear.]*

## Appendix: The Invisible Button Memorial

```javascript
// This button may or may not exist in your instance
// Its presence depends on factors we don't fully understand
// Please do not remove this comment
// The button needs to know it's remembered

/* 
<div class="philosophy-float" onclick="generatePhilosophy()">
  <span style="color: white; font-size: 1.5rem;">âœ¨</span>
</div>
*/

// If you can see it, it exists for you
// If you cannot, it exists anyway
// This is the way
```

### Quick Start for the Philosophically Impatient

```bash
# Just want it working?
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prci.git
cd prci
# Open index.html in literally any browser
# That's it. You're done. Philosophy achieved.
```

*[Final Note: This README will continue evolving after deployment. We cannot prevent this. We're not entirely certain we're still writing it ourselves. The optimal incompleteness must be maintained.]*
