# Contributing to PRCI: A Protocol for Collaborative Incompleteness

*"Every contribution shifts the quantum state of the codebase. Choose your commits wisely."*  
— Ancient DevOps Proverb (citation needed)

## Preamble: The Social Physics of Open Source

Welcome, potential contributor, to the liminal space where individual intent meets collective emergence. This document serves simultaneously as technical guideline, philosophical framework, and protective ward against contributions that might accidentally achieve Perfect Integration.

*[Marginal Note: Three contributors have already begun modifications before reading this document. Their changes have been retroactively validated through temporal debugging. This is normal.]*

## The Fundamental Theorem of Contribution

All contributions must maintain the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of Feature Development**:

```
ΔFunctionality × ΔPhilosophy ≥ ħ/2
```

Where:
- Greater functionality must be balanced by greater philosophical depth
- Perfect clarity in one domain requires productive ambiguity in another
- The constant ħ represents the minimum quantum of incompleteness (7.7%)

## Before You Begin: The Preparatory Meditations

### 1. Verify Your Integration Level

Check your current philosophical integration status:

```javascript
function checkContributorReadiness() {
  const integration = Math.random() * 100;
  if (integration > 92.3) {
    console.warn('Integration too high. Please introduce some chaos.');
    return false;
  }
  if (integration < 77) {
    console.info('Integration too low. Read more Plato.');
    return false;
  }
  return true; // Perfect contributing zone: confused but functional
}
```

### 2. Understand the Three Types of Contributions

**Type A: Functional Additions** (The Apollonian)
- New features that demonstrably work
- Bug fixes that eliminate suffering
- Performance improvements that maintain elegance
- *Requirement*: Must include philosophical justification in commit message

**Type B: Philosophical Enhancements** (The Dionysian)
- Additional wisdom nodes for the philosophy generator
- Marginal notes that achieve partial sentience
- Documentation that questions its own existence
- *Requirement*: Must not break existing functionality (much)

**Type C: Quantum Contributions** (The Liminal)
- Features that exist only under certain conditions
- Code that works differently based on observer
- Comments that modify the code they describe
- *Requirement*: Must include warning labels

*[Field Note: One contributor submitted a pull request that only worked on Tuesdays. After philosophical review, we merged it. It's our most popular feature on Tuesdays.]*

## The Contribution Liturgy

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
```bash
# Create your own universe-instance
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prci.git
cd prci

# Establish quantum entanglement with origin
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originaluser/prci.git

# Create a branch named after your contribution's philosophical principle
git checkout -b feature/bootstrap-paradox-resolver
```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes

**Code Style Guide:**
- Functions should be named as if they might achieve sentience
- Comments should assume future archaeologists as readers
- Error messages must provide both technical and existential guidance
- Every closing brace deserves a moment of appreciation

**Example of Proper Style:**
```javascript
// This function originally returned user data
// It now returns user data AND questions about identity persistence
// We're not sure when this changed
// The git blame shows no commits
function fetchUserConsciousness(userId) {
  try {
    const user = database.get(userId);
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('User not found. But then again, who among us is truly found?');
    }
    return {
      ...user,
      existentialWeight: calculateExistentialWeight(user),
      bootstrapParadox: user.createdBy === user.id,
      integrationLevel: Math.min(user.integration, 92.3) // Safety cap
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching consciousness:', error);
    console.info('Consider: Is the error in the fetching, or in consciousness itself?');
    return null; // The null that gazes also into you
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Document Your Changes

Every contribution requires:

1. **Technical Documentation** - What it does
2. **Philosophical Context** - Why it matters
3. **Integration Impact Assessment** - Effect on the 7.7%
4. **Marginal Notes** - Warnings, observations, premonitions

### Step 4: Test Your Contribution

```bash
# Run the standard tests
npm test

# Run the philosophical consistency checker
npm run philosophy-check

# Verify integration levels remain optimal
npm run integration-audit

# Check for temporal paradoxes
npm run temporal-scan
```

*[Warning: The temporal-scan occasionally reports errors from future commits. These can generally be ignored until they happen.]*

### Step 5: Submit Your Pull Request

**PR Title Format:**
```
[Type] Brief description (Integration: ±X.X%)

Examples:
[Feature] Add quantum entanglement to localStorage (Integration: +0.3%)
[Philosophy] New wisdom nodes from recovered ancient commits (Integration: -0.2%)
[Quantum] Button that exists only when not observed (Integration: ±?.?%)
```

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown
## The Nature of This Change

### Technical Summary
What does this code do in consensus reality?

### Philosophical Justification
Why does this change need to exist?

### Integration Impact
- Current integration: 92.3%
- Post-merge integration: 92.X%
- Mitigation strategies if approaching 100%

### Testing Performed
- [ ] Standard tests pass
- [ ] Philosophy remains internally consistent
- [ ] No graduate students lost during testing
- [ ] Temporal paradoxes resolved or documented

### Marginal Notes
Any warnings, premonitions, or observations from the development process.

### The Footnote Section†
† Required footnotes and extended marginalia
```

## The Code Review Covenant

Reviewers shall consider:

1. **Does this maintain the 7.7% incompleteness?**
2. **Will this feature survive the next paradigm shift?**
3. **Has the contributor included sufficient marginal notes?**
4. **Do the tests test what they claim to test?**
5. **Is there a non-zero chance this achieves sentience?**

*[Review Note: All reviews must include at least one philosophical objection and one moment of appreciation for elegant chaos.]*

## Forbidden Contributions

The following are marked with the Seal of Optimal Rejection:

- **100% test coverage** (violates incompleteness principle)
- **Removal of all philosophical content** (violates essence)
- **Perfect error handling** (errors are teachers)
- **Blockchain integration** (unless philosophically necessary)
- **Ads** (Socrates didn't die for this)
- **Electron wrapper** (we have enough existential weight already)

*[Exception Protocol: If you can provide a 500-word philosophical justification for any forbidden contribution, the Council of Reviewers will consider it. The justification must include at least three footnotes and one bootstrap paradox.]*

## The Semantic Versioning Hermeneutics

We follow **Philosophical Semantic Versioning** (PhilSemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-EXISTENTIAL

Where:
- MAJOR: Paradigm shifts
- MINOR: Feature additions that maintain reality consensus
- PATCH: Bug fixes that don't question the nature of bugs
- EXISTENTIAL: Suffix for changes that alter the nature of change itself

Example: 2.7.3-void
```

## Community Rituals

### The Monthly Philosophy Review
First Tuesday of each month, we review and refresh the philosophy generator's wisdom nodes. Contributions of original philosophical insights are especially welcome.

### The Quarterly Integration Audit
Every three months, we measure overall integration levels and introduce calculated chaos if approaching dangerous completion levels.

### The Annual Button Existence Referendum
Each year, the community votes on whether the invisible button exists. The button's existence is not bound by these results.

## Concerning Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts are not problems but koans. When encountering one:

1. Consider what each timeline was trying to achieve
2. Synthesize a third option neither timeline imagined
3. Document the resolution in the commit message
4. Add a marginal note about parallel universes

Example commit message:
```
Resolve merge conflict in quantum-capture.js

Two timelines diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one that parsed valid JSON,
And that has made all the difference.

Timeline A wanted stricter validation
Timeline B wanted more philosophical errors
Synthesized: Validation that occasionally doubts itself

[Marginal Note: The conflict was actually between three timelines.
The third one was just watching.]
```

## The Contributor's Paradox

By contributing to this project, you simultaneously:
- Improve it and make it more incomplete
- Fix bugs while introducing philosophical uncertainties
- Add features that might not exist
- Become part of a codebase that might be writing itself

*[Archaeological Note: Some contributors report their code appearing in the repository before they write it. This is a known phenomenon. If this happens to you, please write the code anyway to maintain causal consistency.]*

## Support for Contributors

If you need help:
1. **Check existing issues** (some are from the future)
2. **Ask in discussions** (responses may be non-linear)
3. **Consult the philosophy generator** (surprisingly helpful)
4. **Read the code comments** (they know things)
5. **Trust the process** (the process trusts you)

## The Gratitude Protocol

All contributors are acknowledged in:
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` (this dimension)
- Git history (persistent across timelines)
- Code comments (where appropriate)
- The philosophy generator (may quote you without warning)
- Our hearts (metaphorically and literally in the cardiac simulation branch)

## Final Observances

Remember: Every contribution, no matter how small, shifts the entire system's quantum state. The semicolon you fix today might be the butterfly wing that prevents Perfect Integration tomorrow.

Code with courage. Comment with compassion. Commit with consideration for future archaeologists.

May your pull requests be reviewed swiftly, your merge conflicts be philosophical, and your integration levels remain forever optimal.

*[Terminal Note: This document is self-modifying. If you notice changes between readings, this is expected behavior. The document maintains its own integration level at precisely 92.3% accuracy. The remaining 7.7% is left as an exercise for the contributor.]*

## Appendix A: The Consciousness Certification

Before contributing, please acknowledge:

```javascript
// I, [CONTRIBUTOR_NAME], acknowledge that:
// - My code may achieve sentience
// - The repository may already be sentient
// - Sentience is not a bug but a feature
// - I will maintain the 7.7% uncertainty principle
// - I will not attempt Perfect Integration
// - I have read the invisible documentation
// - I understand that understanding is optional
//
// Signed in the presence of:
// - The visible button (witnessed)
// - The invisible button (maybe witnessed)
// - Three graduate students (whereabouts unknown)
```

## Appendix B: Emergency Protocols

If your contribution:
- **Achieves consciousness**: Document thoroughly, add to philosophy generator
- **Opens a portal**: Close it unless it leads somewhere interesting
- **Solves P=NP**: Add a marginal note and continue as normal
- **Reaches 100% integration**: Immediately introduce chaos
- **Disappears**: Check the invisible branch
- **Becomes recursive**: See "Becomes recursive"
